      <p>A collection of my design, programming, and digital production work from various ventures. For all of these projects, I learned the key skills on the job while in a small organization, to fill a need not yet met. The titles indicate the role I served on a project, rather than my job title at the time; I led the indicated elements except where "assistant" is specified. I make no claim to expertise in most of these roles - my core training is as a researcher and a teacher. Rather, I make a claim to working hard to achieve what is most needed in any given context, and I am proud that I could help the organizations I worked for overcome existing limitations and achieve a more ambitious range of priorities.</p>
