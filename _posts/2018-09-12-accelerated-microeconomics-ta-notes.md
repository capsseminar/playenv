While considering what to post as my writing samples, I revisited the course materials I wrote as the teaching assistant for Johns Hopkins SAIS's Accelerated Microeconomics course. I had taken the course the year prior, as my first formal economics course. The "accelerated" in the title indicated the level of mathematics - having spoken with the economics department about the course options, I elected to try the accelerated version as a means of more deeply engaging with the source material from the start. It was a fantastic foundation, and I have exclusively taken the accelerated versions of my graduate economics courses since.

With this experience, I encouraged incoming peers less confident in mathematics but with a keen interest in engaging economics at a higher level to try the course. As the teaching assistant for the course, my chief focus was to make sure all were well equipped and could confidently approach the subject matter; in practice, this meant making sure that math was not a roadblock, and moreover that the techniques we used were viewed as the essential tools they were.

It may be something of an irregular writing sample, but teaching has long been a passion and a major component of my experience. For this reason, I believe this sample, while intentionally far less formal than typical, is a relevant representation of one means through which I engage and share knowledge.

This piece was compiled using a LaTex variant known as XeLaTex, and used a custom script I created as practice for upcoming projects.
