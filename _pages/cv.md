Like many, I have spent my life to date working to make ends meet. Like too few, I have had incredible fortune in securing educational opportunities and the support of mentors. Now I pursue a new future, in which my work meets greater ends.

### I am currently looking for career opportunities in research and consulting with a start date of June 2019 or after.
I generally make myself available for contract work and freelance consulting. Given my current roster, I will be unable to take on new work until May 2019. Please be in touch any time if you have upcoming projects or research questions you would like to discuss for future.
