Like many, I have spent my life to date working to make ends meet. Like too few, I have had incredible fortune in securing educational opportunities and the support of mentors. Now I pursue a new future, in which my work meets my ends.

I am currently concluding my master's degree at Johns Hopkins SAIS; my concentration is in China Studies and International Economics with a focus on energy and environment. As a master's candidate in Washington, DC, I have continued to conduct private sector research and analysis. Additionally, I serve as a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, a member of the editorial board at the academic journal *The SAIS Review of International Affairs*, and the assistant to the editor-in-chief of the Korea-based academic journal *Asian Perspective*.

Between classes and work, I also work with two fantastic entrepreneurs - an engineer from Hong Kong and Canada and a strategic studies concentrator from Germany - on designing an artificial intelligence policy course. Not the fluffy stuff - all the technical details of reinforcement learning necessary for governing complex systems. I am far more a student than a leader in this initiative, and given the team, proud to be so.

### I am currently looking for career opportunities with a start date of June 2019 or after.
I generally make myself available for contract work and freelance consulting. Given my current roster, I will be unable to take on new work until May 2019. Please be in touch any time if you have upcoming projects or research questions you would like to discuss for future.
