This website was built through GitHub Pages using Jekyll; the base theme is free and open source software licensed under the MIT license. The original version of the theme was developed by [Vangelis Tzortzis](http://vangeltzo.com/) and ported for Jekyll by [Taylan Tatli](https://taylantatli.github.io/). The various customizations and recoded portions from Taylan Tatli's version are my own - a way of making a small contribution to something I came across that was leagues above what I created from scratch on my own. Many thanks to Tzortzis and Tatli!
