## Asia, Energy, and Environmental Governance

With a total of ten years overseas in Europe, Asia, and South America, and a background in both the hard and social sciences, I aim always to ask: through what further perspectives can we better understand the issues at hand?

At present, I am concluding my master's degree at Johns Hopkins SAIS; my concentration is in China Studies and International Economics with a focus on energy and environment. As a master's candidate in Washington, DC, I have continued to conduct private sector research and analysis. Additionally, I serve as a research assistant at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute, a member of the editorial board at the academic journal *The SAIS Review of International Affairs*, and the assistant to the editor-in-chief of the Korea-based academic journal *Asian Perspective*.

Between classes and work, I also work with two fantastic entrepreneurs - an engineer from Hong Kong and Canada and a strategic studies concentrator from Germany - on designing an artificial intelligence policy course. Not the fluffy stuff - all the technical details of reinforcement learning necessary for governing complex systems. I am far more a student than a leader in this initiative, and given the team, proud to be so.

### I am currently looking for career opportunities with a start date of June 2019 or after.
In general, I make myself available for contract work and freelance consulting. Given my current roster, I will be unable to take on new initiatives until May 2019. Please be in touch any time if you have upcoming projects or research questions you would like to discuss for future. This site features select writing samples and projects, along with my long-form CV; feel free to explore and drop me a note via the email icon or any other service!
